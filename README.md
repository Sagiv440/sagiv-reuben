<br/><br/>

<h3 class="font-bold text-2xl">How To</h3>
<p>
<strong>Add Projects/Timeline:</strong><br/>
The website loads a JSON file from the web that stores all website data.  
This allows you to change the content of the website without touching its code.<br/>
The JSON file URLs can be found in: <code>src/constants/index.js</code> under the variables  
<code>PROJECTS_FILE_URL</code> and <code>TIMELINE_FILE_URL</code>.<br/>
Example files <code>Projects.json</code> and <code>Experience.json</code> are also included.
<br/><br/>

<strong>Change Colors</strong><br/>
To change the website's color theme, go to the root folder and open the <code>tailwind.config</code> file.  
This file controls all colors used in the website — from backgrounds to text.
<br/><br/>

<h3 class="font-bold text-2xl">My Role</h3>
<p>
  I developed the entire frontend from the ground up, including UI and layout design,
  component structure, navigation and routing, mobile-first design, animation setup,
  performance optimizations, and deployment configuration. This project strengthened
  my understanding of reusable component patterns, UI design, and modern frontend workflows.
