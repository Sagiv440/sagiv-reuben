The core of the game consists of individual units with their own AI, allowing them to make decisions, and a larger army manager that organizes and sorts them as it passes down orders from the player or the AI. The enemy AI uses a simple minimax algorithm that translates the battlefield into a tree of possible choices, each assigned a value. This system gives the AI the flexibility to plan ahead and respond to the player's behavior while remaining performance efficient. To implement many of these systems, I relied on features of .NET and C#, such as events and delegates, to allow units to subscribe and unsubscribe to receive orders from the manager as they are being selected.</p><br/><p><strong>Link to the video demo:</strong> <a href='https://youtu.be/5TpPYrwQT54' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='text-secondary' >here</a></p><br/><h3 class='font-bold text-2xl'>How To Play</h3><ol><li>● 1.

This allows us to read — and occasionally write — data to the controller.</p><br/><p class='font-bold text-2xl'>Wi-Fi</p><p>For an extra challenge, I decided that in order to view high scores from all players, the ESP32 should connect to Wi-Fi and display them through a browser interface. In the game's options menu, there is a “Network” option that lets the ESP32 connect to any nearby Wi-Fi network.</p><br/><p class='font-bold text-2xl'>Tetris</p><p>There isn’t much to say — it’s Tetris, or at least a close version of it. The game itself was originally an older project of mine written in C++. Feeling confident that I could adapt it, and knowing that squares are the easiest thing to draw on the screen, it was the perfect fit for our project.</p>\n\n",

Although simplified, it mimics the logic that generates NES-style sound output.<br/><br/><strong>Cartridge & Mapper System:</strong><br/>Supports loading NES ROMs and interpreting their metadata. Implements mapper logic to handle bank switching, memory mirroring, and game-specific hardware behavior.<br/><br/><strong>Memory Bus & Timing:</strong><br/>Coordinates communication between CPU, PPU, cartridge, and RAM. Ensures accurate cycle-level timing so instructions and rendering stay synchronized.<br/><br/><strong>Debugging & Display Tools:</strong><br/>Includes optional visualization components such as CPU state monitoring, tile viewer prototypes, and test ROM compatibility for diagnosing accuracy.<br/><br/></p><p>This emulator was created as a hands-on learning experience—an exploration into how low-level hardware, assembly execution, and real-time rendering work together in a classic game console.</p>",

As a kid, this was incredibly handy — everything existed in one place, making the workflow very easy. I could create models in one scene and immediately use them in the game in another.\nThis is also where I first learned about key concepts like frame-time optimization and basic event systems.\n</p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 class='font-bold text-2xl'>Programming</h3>\n<p>\nOnce all the assets were created, I needed a way to control their logic. Fortunately, Blender had the solution built in. Back then, Blender included a node-based logic editor. It was rough, mostly good for simple logic, while the finer adjustments were handled through Python scripts.\nFor me, it was perfect — all game events and inputs were managed through this system, from menu logic to the level manager to the player controller.\n</p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 class='font-bold text-2xl'>How to Play</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>● Use the mouse to aim the machine gun.</li>\n<li>● Right-click to fire the machine gun.</li>\n<li>● Left-click to call in artillery support (has a cooldown, so use it wisely).</li>\n<li>● Press <strong>TAB</strong> to pause the game.</li>\n</ol>\n\n",
