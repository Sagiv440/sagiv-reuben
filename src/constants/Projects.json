The core of the game consists of individual units with their own AI, allowing them to make decisions, and a larger army manager that organizes and sorts them as it passes down orders from the player or the AI. The enemy AI uses a simple minimax algorithm that translates the battlefield into a tree of possible choices, each assigned a value. This system gives the AI the flexibility to plan ahead and respond to the player's behavior while remaining performance efficient. To implement many of these systems, I relied on features of .NET and C#, such as events and delegates, to allow units to subscribe and unsubscribe to receive orders from the manager as they are being selected.</p><br/><p><strong>Link to the video demo:</strong> <a href='https://youtu.be/5TpPYrwQT54' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a></p><br/><h3>How To Play</h3><br/><ol><li>-1. Use the <code>right mouse</code> button to select the troop you want to move and the <code>left mouse</code> button to click where you want it to move.</li><li>-2. Hold <code>left shift</code> while clicking the <code>right mouse</code> button on troops to control multiple troops at the same time.</li><li>-3. Click on the base to buy more units.</li><li>Capture resource points to secure more resources for your army.</li><li>-4.

The CPU executes instructions cycle by cycle, ensuring accurate synchronization with the rest of the system.<br/><br/><strong>PPU (Picture Processing Unit):</strong><br/>Replicates the NES graphics hardware, including background rendering, sprite evaluation, palette handling, scroll registers, and the full 262-scanline pipeline. This enables correct drawing of tiles, sprites, and frame updates.<br/><br/><strong>APU (Audio Processing Unit):</strong><br/>Simulates the system’s audio channels—pulse, triangle, noise, and DMC. Although simplified, it mimics the logic that generates NES-style sound output.<br/><br/><strong>Cartridge & Mapper System:</strong><br/>Supports loading NES ROMs and interpreting their metadata. Implements mapper logic to handle bank switching, memory mirroring, and game-specific hardware behavior.<br/><br/><strong>Memory Bus & Timing:</strong><br/>Coordinates communication between CPU, PPU, cartridge, and RAM. Ensures accurate cycle-level timing so instructions and rendering stay synchronized.<br/><br/><strong>Debugging & Display Tools:</strong><br/>Includes optional visualization components such as CPU state monitoring, tile viewer prototypes, and test ROM compatibility for diagnosing accuracy.<br/><br/></p><p>This emulator was created as a hands-on learning experience—an exploration into how low-level hardware, assembly execution, and real-time rendering work together in a classic game console.</p>",
