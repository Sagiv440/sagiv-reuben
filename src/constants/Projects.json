The core of the game consists of individual units with their own AI, allowing them to make decisions, and a larger army manager that organizes and sorts them as it passes down orders from the player or the AI. The enemy AI uses a simple minimax algorithm that translates the battlefield into a tree of possible choices, each assigned a value. This system gives the AI the flexibility to plan ahead and respond to the player's behavior while remaining performance efficient. To implement many of these systems, I relied on features of .NET and C#, such as events and delegates, to allow units to subscribe and unsubscribe to receive orders from the manager as they are being selected.</p><br/><p><strong>Link to the video demo:</strong> <a href='https://youtu.be/5TpPYrwQT54' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='text-secondary' >here</a></p><br/><h3 class='font-bold text-2xl'>How To Play</h3><ol><li>● 1.

In the game's options menu, there is a “Network” option that lets the ESP32 connect to any nearby Wi-Fi network.</p><br/><p class='font-bold text-2xl'>Tetris</p><p>There isn’t much to say — it’s Tetris, or at least a close version of it.

      "body": "<p><br>As part of the Global Game Jam 2026 competition, me and a couple of friends from the industry came together to make this game.<br/>\n\nThis year the theme for the competition was \"Masks\". <br/>\n<br/>\nRough Shinobi is a 2D platformer centered around a ninja that fights other ninjas. The main goal of the game is to reach the end of the level. This is accomplished by using power masks. Each enemy carries a mask that gives them power; by killing them, you can pick up the mask and wear it, gaining its power. <br/>\n\nWith a full set of 2D controls, a simple system, and an extra slot for holding an additional mask, it offers a full and challenging experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this project I took the role of general programmer and game developer, handling all the technical tasks: code structure, implementing core game mechanics, and bug fixes. <br/>\n\nMy team’s responsibility was mainly creating art, VFX, and animation, with AI supplementing the rest, such as placeholders and audio.<br/>\n<br/></p>\n\n<p classname='font-bold' >Special thanks to:&nbsp;<br/><a class='text-secondary' lang='' title='View user profile.' href='https://globalgamejam.org/users/danshomrony'>Dan Shomrony</a>: Artist, Game Designer</p>\n\n<p><a class='text-secondary' lang='' title='View user profile.' href='https://globalgamejam.org/users/dekel-carolla'>Dekel Carolla</a>: VFX Art, Animations</p>\n\n<p><a class='text-secondary' lang='' title='View user profile.' href='https://globalgamejam.org/users/sagiv440'>Sagiv Reuben</a>: Programmer, Game Developer</p>\n<br/><br/>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://itch.io/embed/4255754?dark=true\" width=\"552\" height=\"167\"><a href=\"https://sagiv440.itch.io/rough-shinobi\">Rouge Shinobi by Sagiv440</a></iframe>\n",

The template provides a clean structure, a modern\n  layout, and easy customization so users can focus on presenting their work\n  and identity.\n</p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 class=\"font-bold text-2xl\">Goals and Purpose</h3>\n<p>\n  - Provide an accessible starting point for people with little or no frontend experience.<br/>\n  - Offer a modern, responsive design that works across all devices.<br/>\n  - Allow users to customize their personal website by editing simple data files or React components.<br/>\n  - Demonstrate how to structure a professional personal website using React.\n</p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 class=\"font-bold text-2xl\">Features</h3>\n<p>\n  <strong>Modern and Responsive UI</strong><br/>\n  Clean and minimal design that works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.\n  <br/><br/>\n\n  <strong>Built with React</strong><br/>\n  Component-based architecture with reusable, modular code that is easy to extend.\n  <br/><br/>\n\n  <strong>Dynamic Project Viewer</strong><br/>\n  Loads projects from JSON or local files, includes built-in filtering and search,\n  and supports detailed project pages with images, videos, and descriptions.\n  <br/><br/>\n\n  <strong>Smooth Animations</strong><br/>\n  Uses Framer Motion to create fluid section transitions and animated UI elements.\n  <br/><br/>\n\n  <strong>Easy Content Editing</strong><br/>\n  Sections such as About Me, Projects, and Skills can be edited without any backend setup.\n  <br/><br/>\n\n  <strong>Hash-Based Routing</strong><br/>\n  Fully compatible with static hosting platforms like GitHub Pages.\n  <br/><br/>\n\n  <strong>Lightweight and Fast</strong><br/>\n  Optimized build, efficient asset loading, and minimal dependencies.\n</p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 class=\"font-bold text-2xl\">How To</h3>\n<p>\n<strong>Add Projects/Timeline:</strong><br/>\nThe website loads a JSON file from the web that stores all website data.  \nThis allows you to change the content of the website without touching its code.<br/>\nThe JSON file URLs can be found in: <code>src/constants/index.js</code> under the variables  \n<code>PROJECTS_FILE_URL</code> and <code>TIMELINE_FILE_URL</code>.<br/>\nExample files <code>Projects.json</code> and <code>Experience.json</code> are also included.\n<br/><br/>\n\n<strong>Change Colors</strong><br/>\nTo change the website's color theme, go to the root folder and open the <code>tailwind.config</code> file.  \nThis file controls all colors used in the website — from backgrounds to text.\n<br/><br/>\n</p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 class=\"font-bold text-2xl\">My Role</h3>\n<p>\n  I developed the entire frontend from the ground up, including UI and layout design,\n  component structure, navigation and routing, mobile-first design, animation setup,\n  performance optimizations, and deployment configuration. This project strengthened\n  my understanding of reusable component patterns, UI design, and modern frontend workflows.\n</p>\n\n",
