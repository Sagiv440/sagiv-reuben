The core of the game consists of individual units with their own AI, allowing them to make some decisions, and a larger army manager that organizes and sorts them as it passes down orders from the player or the AI. The enemy AI is a simple Minimax algorithm that translates the battlefield into a tree of possible choices, each assigned a value. This system gives the AI the flexibility to plan ahead and respond to the player's behavior, all while being very performance efficient. To implement many of these systems, I relied on many features of .NET and C#, such as events and delegates, to allow units to subscribe and unsubscribe to receive orders from the manager as they are being selected.",
